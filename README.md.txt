Course Overview
In this course, I am learning essential Excel functions and techniques for data analysis. The course covers a variety of topics, ranging from basic functions to more advanced ones, aimed at improving data manipulation, analysis, and visualization skills.

Key Areas of Learning:
Basic Excel functions: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.
Conditional functions: IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF, etc.
Lookup and reference functions: VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, etc.
Data visualization: Creating charts and graphs.
Data cleaning: Removing duplicates, using filters, and conditional formatting.
Excel Functions Covered
Here are some of the primary Excel functions and techniques I have explored so far:

SUM - Adds values.
AVERAGE - Finds the average of a range of values.
COUNTIF - Counts cells that meet a condition.
VLOOKUP - Looks up a value in a vertical range.
HLOOKUP - Looks up a value in a horizontal range.
IF - Applies conditional logic to data.
SUMIF - Sums values based on a condition.
INDEX - Returns the value of a cell in a specific row/column.
MATCH - Finds the position of a specific value.
TEXT - Formats numbers and dates into a specific text format.
As I progress through the course, I'll be adding more functions and examples.

Files and Directories
The repository is structured as follows:

excel_functions/: Contains Excel files with examples of the functions Iâ€™m learning.
project_files/: Contains any project files where I apply these Excel functions in real-life scenarios.
notes/: Contains text notes and explanations of the functions covered in the course.
Feel free to explore each directory for relevant examples, and use the files to practice these Excel functions!
